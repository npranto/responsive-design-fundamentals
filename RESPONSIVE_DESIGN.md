Hardware Pixels vs Device Independent Pixels
- Hardware pixels refer to the actual physical number of pixels on a device whereas device independent pixels (DIP) is an unit of measurement that relate pixels to actual distance. The browser uses DIP measurement to show different sites in different screen sizes

CSS pixels = device hardware pixels / device independent pixels
i.e., 
	a tablet with width of 640px and dip of 2 would have viewport width of (640/2) = 320px;
